I've made this website to practice my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features
* You can create, read, update and delete tasks.
* You can mark the tasks as completed.
* There are three task categories: Active, completed and all. You can select which category you want to view by using the button located at the top-right corner of the page.
* You can delete all the tasks at once in the category that is currently viewed, by using the "Clear" button in the menu located at the top of the page.
* Tasks don't get removed after you close the page.
* You can use the website in both mobile and desktop devices.
